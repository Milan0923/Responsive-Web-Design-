                polesitter and fellow Ducati rider, Jorge Martin out at the opening race at Losail in Qatar. At the <br>
                second round of the season, at a wet Mandalika circuit, Bagnaia took home a disappointing 15th place, <br> 
                collecting only one point in the opening two races of the season. Two fifth places at COTA and the <br>
                Argentinian Grand Prix and an eighth place in Portimao were followed up until Jerez, a track where <br>
                Bagnaia has had success earlier in his career.</h4>

            The MotoGP World Championship consists of 21 Grand Prix. Each race lasts between 40 and 45 minutes over a distance of between 100 and 130 km, depending on the circuit. <br>
            MotoGP bikes are as quick a F1 cars. 1000cc 4 stroke MotoGP bikes top out at just over 220 mph, which is only slightly slower than the Formula One record of 231 mph. <br>
            F1 cars average around 118 mph around the track roughly 10 mph more than the MotoGP bikes. A crazy power to rate ratio. Honda holds the record for the most Grand Prix <br> 
            victories on the premier class, having won 313 times. Yamaha is second with 245 wins, and MV Agusta is third with 139 wins.</h4><br>
